# Flow Control
#### Importance of Flow Control
Programing is just a series of instructions, but programming’s real strength isn’t just running one instruction after another like a weekend errand list. Based on how expressions evaluate, a program can decide to skip instructions, repeat them, or choose one of several instructions to run.

Flow control statements can decide which Python instructions to execute under specific conditions. Before learning about flow control statements, first we need to learn how to represent yes (True) and no (False) options, and we need to understand how to write those branching points as Python code by understanding: <b>Boolean values, comparison operators, and Boolean operators</b>.

### Boolean Values
- Only 2 Values: True or False 
- Rules: 
  - Lack the quotes you place around strings
  - They always start with a capital T or F
  - Boolean values are used in expressions and can be stored in variables
  - True or False cannot be variable names
### Comparison Operators (Relational Operators)
- Compare two values and evaluate down to a single Boolean value, then your code continues based on the specific conditions.

### Boolean Operators
- Three Boolean operators: <b> AND, OR, NOT </b> 
- Like comparison operators, they evaluate these expressions down to a Boolean value
- The <b>AND</b> operator evaluates an expression to True <u>if both<u> Boolean values are True; otherwise, it evaluates to False.

- The <b>OR</b> operator evaluates an expression to True <u>if either<u> of the two Boolean values is True. If both are False, it evaluates to False.
