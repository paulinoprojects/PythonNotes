# Flow Control
#### Importance of Flow Control
Programing is just a series of instructions, but programming’s real strength isn’t just running one instruction after another like a weekend errand list. Based on how expressions evaluate, a program can decide to skip instructions, repeat them, or choose one of several instructions to run.

Flow control statements can decide which Python instructions to execute under specific conditions. Before learning about flow control statements, first we need to learn how to represent yes (True) and no (False) options, and we need to understand how to write those branching points as Python code by understanding: <b>Boolean values, comparison operators, and Boolean operators</b>.
